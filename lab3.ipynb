    "1. *Understand how to use Pytorch to write a Neural Network*\n",
    "2. *Write a neural network with multiple hidden layers*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous labs we saw how to write a Neural Network with one hidden layer to solve various problems. The main issue with writing a network from scratch is that it becomes quite tedious to work with multiple layers, especially when, in the training phase, we want to tweak our network. As an example, if we wanted to change the activation functions, the error functions or the optimiser (for instance using something different than classic gradient descent) that would imply rewriting the vast majority of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily there are several libraries in Python that help us automate the process of writing a network in a modular way. The one we are going to explore in this module is Pytorch."

    "Pytorch uses a specific data structure to handle data, called a \"tensor\". In the context of deep learning, a tensor is the generalisation of an array or a matrix in an arbitrary number of dimensions (for instance, a vector and a matrix would be a 1-dimensional and a 2-dimensional tensors respectively). The dimensionality of a tensor coincides with the number of indexes used to refer to scalar values within the tensor.\n",

Pytorch, no matter how complicated your model is, will compute them automatically."

    "There is slight increase in accuracy when the activation functions is changed from sigmoid to ReLU. This advantage comes from the  derivative of the sigmoid function being very close to zero for small and large values. When calculating a weight's error derivative at the start of the network, a lot of sigmoid derivatives are multiplied with each (one for each layer), leading to \"gradient-vanishing\", where weights practically not being updated. Using the ReLU (whose gradient is either zero or one) would solves this problem entirely, the effect of which would be more apparent if the number of network layers is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the performance impact is much more signifcant when the optimiser is changed from SGD to the Adam. SGD, while very simple to understand and useful in many scenarios, fails to train more complex networks due to the presence of too many local minima. In addition, SGD is notorious for having poor numerical performance in \"ill-conditioned problems\", where a small change in the input can have a large change in function value, i.e. errors will be magnified. The Adam algorithm, however, has a much better affinity to solving large problems, which this handwriting classification scenario is."
