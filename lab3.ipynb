    "Objectives:\n",
    "1. *Understand how to use Pytorch to write a Neural Network*\n",
    "2. *Write a neural network with multiple hidden layers*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous labs we saw how to write a Neural Network with one hidden layer to solve various problems. The main issue with writing a network from scratch is that it becomes quite tedious to work with multiple layers, especially when, in the training phase, we want to tweak our network. As an example, if we wanted to change the activation functions, the error functions or the optimiser (for instance using something different than classic gradient descent) that would imply rewriting the vast majority of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily there are several libraries in Python that help us automate the process of writing a network in a modular way. The one we are going to explore in this module is Pytorch."

    "Pytorch uses a specific data structure to handle data, called a \"tensor\". In the context of deep learning, a tensor is the generalisation of an array or a matrix in an arbitrary number of dimensions (for instance, a vector and a matrix would be a 1-dimensional and a 2-dimensional tensors respectively). The dimensionality of a tensor coincides with the number of indexes used to refer to scalar values within the tensor.\n",

    "A great feature of Pytorch is `Autograd`. PyTorch tensors keep track of the operations that involved them and they automatically provide the series of derivatives with respect to their inputs. This means you wonâ€™t need to write expressions for the backpropagation algorithm and compute derivatives by hand, as was done in previous labs. Pytorch, no matter how complicated your model is, will compute them automatically."
